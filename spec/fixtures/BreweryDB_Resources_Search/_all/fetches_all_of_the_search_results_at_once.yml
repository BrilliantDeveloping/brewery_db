        Pale Ale dates back to the 1700''s when Britain needed a hearty beer to ship
        to her troops in India. Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to
        get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized
        that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane
        I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive
        crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row
        barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result
        is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual
        sweetness.","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
