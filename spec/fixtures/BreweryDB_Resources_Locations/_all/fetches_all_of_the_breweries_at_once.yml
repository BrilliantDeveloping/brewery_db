        The common response back in 2009 was, \u201cWe like arts and crafts\u201d.
        The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco
        on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became
        apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective
        that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first
        night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the
        historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called
        this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation
        and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew
        Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was
        started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would
        be available for many different palates in many different communities. There
        is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations
        of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur
        philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are
        active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local
        charities.","website":"http:\/\/www.pinestreetbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_Mhj095-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        amazing and historic WPA frescoes created by Lucien Labaudt in the 1930''s.
        The artwork captures the flavor of San Francisco in that era in a style of
        the Arts and Crafts movement \u2013 a must see for fans of the style and for
        anyone who wants a taste of the strange and incredible period in which the
        WPA allowed art projects like this to exist during such hard times.\r\n\r\nUpstairs
        you will find the Beach Chalet Brewery & Restaurant. It was developed by Gar
        and Lara Truppelli and Timon Malloy in 1997 after the Chalet had sat vacant
        for 17 years. To remodel and restore this historic building to its former
        glory so it could be a landmark to be enjoyed by future generations as well
        as to create a space for their restaurateurs\u2019 dreams, they brought Heller
        Manus Architects onboard to help make their dreams a reality.\r\n\r\nToday
        thousands of guests enjoy the Modern American Cuisine menu and hand crafted
        ales. The Beach Chalet offers a full bar, abundant free parking and a breathtaking
        ocean view. Bay Area residents and visitors find the Beach Chalet to be a
        wonderful San Francisco experience while visiting Golden Gate Park and Ocean
        Beach. Join us and find out why the Beach Chalet is your kind of place.","website":"http:\/\/www.beachchalet.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rGUQ04\/upload_mrm1Fb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rGUQ04\/upload_mrm1Fb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rGUQ04\/upload_mrm1Fb-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Company","description":"Since my first home brew many years ago, I\u2019d
        been dreaming of opening a brewery. I had no idea if that dream would come
        true or if it did what I\u2019d call it, but I was open to naming my dream.
        One summer Sunday in 1991 I was reading the San Francisco Chronicle. A head
        line in the front section blazed into my brain: Thirsty Bear Bites Man for
        Cold Beer. After reading about the Bear biting Victor Kozlov\u2019s hand to
        get a cold beer, I knew that story would be the name of my dream. The article,
        neatly cut out, lived on my refrigerator door for the next five years until
        I gave it greater purpose by opening ThirstyBear Brewing Company. You are
        looking at the original cut out article. Victor Kozlov\u2019s sacrifice of
        his hard earned beer to the Bear has earned him immortal status in our house
        beer, Kozlov Stout.","website":"http:\/\/www.thirstybear.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_Nlsfj6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_Nlsfj6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8zULxL\/upload_Nlsfj6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
